# Portfolio

As I don't write code intended for anyone else to look at/work on, I had to create this github for the application. As such, I've uploaded some examples of my work across different projects. A brief rxplination of them:

seq_dep_all_plot.py: this is an example of data visualisation. It plots three different parameters relevant to my work on DNA and was written to plot data for my PhD thesis.
